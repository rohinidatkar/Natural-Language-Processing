# Natural Language Processing Assignment

This project demonstrates various Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques using Python. The primary goal is to process and analyze textual data, performing tasks such as text preprocessing, sentiment analysis, and topic modeling. The notebook includes the following tasks:

1. **Text Preprocessing**: Tokenization, removing stopwords, stemming, and lemmatization.
2. **Sentiment Analysis**: Using libraries like NLTK and TextBlob to determine the sentiment of text data.
3. **Topic Modeling**: Implementing Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) to identify topics within a collection of documents.
